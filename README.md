# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
This assignment for this project is to compare several schools within the school district. Standardized tests scores for reading and maths were provided. Throughout this exercise, we grouped the schools by test score, passing percentages, budgets per capita, and even whether or not a school was a District School or a Charter School.

Additionally, there is a case of academic dishonesty present in Thomas High School that affects the 9th grade test scores. Rendering the dataset flawed due to such limited dishonesty is not an open for the school district. I was tasked with identifying and replacing the inaccurate 9th Grade test scores from Thomas High School and conducting analysis on the "clean data". By removing the inaccurate data, true insights were extracted that affect each school's overall standing among others, and also provided Thomas High School principles and teachers with honest, accurate data on the test scores for students in tenth, eleventh, and twlefth grades.
